MicroOVN services
=================

This page presents a list of all MicroOVN services. Their descriptions are
for reference only - the user is not expected to interact directly with these
services.

The status of all services is displayed by running:

.. code-block:: none

   snap services microovn

``microovn.central``
--------------------

.. warning::

   The ``microovn.central`` service is deprecated and will be removed in a
   future release.

This is a transitional service. Starting this service will start and enable
multiple services:

* ``microovn.ovn-ovsdb-server-nb``
* ``microovn.ovn-ovsdb-server-sb``
* ``microovn.ovn-northd``

However this service is not capable of stopping these child services so its
usage is strongly discouraged. Users should use individual services instead.

``microovn.chassis``

This service maps directly to the ``ovn-controller`` daemon.

``microovn.daemon``

handles communication with other MicroOVN cluster members and provides an API
for the ``microovn`` client command.

This service maps directly to the ``OVN Northbound`` database/service.

``microovn.ovn-northd``
-----------------------

``microovn.ovn-ovsdb-server-sb``
--------------------------------

``microovn.refresh-expiring-certs``
-----------------------------------

This service is a recurring process that runs once a day between ``02:00`` and
