==========================
Documentation starter pack
==========================

See the `Sphinx and Read the Docs`_ guide for instructions on how to get
started with Sphinx documentation. Then go through the following sections to
use this starter pack to set up your docs repository.

Set up your documentation repository
------------------------------------

You can either create a standalone documentation project based on this
repository or include the files from this repository in a dedicated
documentation folder in an existing code repository.

**Note:** We're planning to provide the contents of this repository as an
installable package in the future, but currently, you need to copy and update
the required files manually.

Standalone documentation repository
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To create a standalone documentation repository, clone this starter pack
repository, `update the configuration <#configure-the-documentation>`_, and
then commit all files to your own documentation repository.

You don't need to move any files, and you don't need to do any special
configuration on Read the Docs.

Documentation in a code repository
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To add documentation to an existing code repository:

#. create a directory called ``docs`` at the root of the code repository
#. populate the above directory with the contents of the starter pack
   repository (with the exception of the ``.git`` directory)
#. copy the file(s) located in the ``docs/.github/workflows`` directory into
   the code repository's ``.github/workflows`` directory
#. in the above file(s), change the values of the ``working-directory`` and
   ``workdir`` fields from "." to "docs"

.. note::

   When configuring RTD itself for your project, the setting **Path for
   .readthedocs.yaml** (under **Advanced Settings**) will need to be given the
   value of "docs/.readthedocs.yaml".

Add your project information
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In ``conf.py``, check or edit the following settings in the **Project
information** section:

* ``project``
* ``author``
* ``copyright`` - in most cases, replace the first ``%s`` with the year the
  project started
* ``release`` - only required if you're actually using release numbers (beyond
  the scope of this guide, but you can also use Python to pull this out of your
  code itself)
* ``ogp_site_url`` - the URL of the documentation output (needed to generate a
  preview when linking from another website)
* ``ogp_site_name`` - the title you want to use for the documentation in
  previews on other websites (by default, this is set to the project name)
* ``ogp_image`` - an image that will be used in the preview on other websites
* ``html_favicon`` - the favicon for the documentation (circle of friends by
  default)

In the file's ``html_context`` variable, update the following settings:

* ``discourse_prefix`` - the URL to the Discourse instance your project uses
  (needed to add links to posts using the ``:discourse:`` metadata at the top
  of a file)
* ``github_url`` - the link to your GitHub repository (needed to create the
  Edit link in the footer and the feedback button)
* ``github_version`` - the branch that contains this version of the
  documentation
* ``github_folder`` - the folder that contains the documentation files

Save your changes.

Activate/deactivate feedback button
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A feedback button is included by default, which appears at the top of each page
in the documentation. It redirects users to your GitHub issues page, and
populates an issue for them with details of the page they were on when they
clicked the button.

If your project does not use GitHub issues, set the ``github_issues`` variable
in the ``conf.py`` file to an empty value to disable both the feedback button
and the issue link in the footer.
If you want to deactivate only the feedback button, but keep the link in the
footer, remove the ``github_issue_links.js`` script from the ``conf.py`` file.

Next steps
----------

Now that your repository is enabled for doc builds you should:

* rename this present file (``readme.rst``) to ``setup.rst``
* rename file ``working-with-the-docs.rst`` to ``readme.rst``

The new ``readme.rst`` file shows contributors how to work with the
documentation. For a standalone documentation scenario, it will be the
repository's main README file. For the integrated scenario (i.e. documentation
in a code repository), it will remain in the ``docs`` directory where it can be
linked to from your project's main README file.
